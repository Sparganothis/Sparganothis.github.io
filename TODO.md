## custom game / mspaint
- save a difgferent strucct "GameBoardCustomM" that only contains editable things in mspaint.exe (avoid dropping old custom game baords)

## bugs
- cannot replay bot games (stuck on first move)
- if spectating eded game, UI blocked on gamme over instead of redirecting to replay
- if spectating match, UI should refresh ended games with the replay
- 
- 1v1 online complete disaster.
- 1v1 + man vs car : if open seccond tab on /mathc/ link, it's allowed to play, should be redirect  to /spectate-match/
- man vs. car: replay is not working for Bot games.
