On the first night, I said: "let this be 1984 falling block puzzle game".

But Bafo, the compiler god of anguish, whispered from below:

"Error[E0507]: cannot move out of 的理, which is behind a shared reference".

And so it began. 

At first, I thought it was just a glitch in the system.

But as I continued to code, I realized that something was off.

The blocks wouldn't fall into place, no matter how hard I tried.

Voices echoed in my mind, taunting me with the same words over and over again.

_Clone. Clone. Clone. Clone._

Frustration turned into madness as I became consumed by the occult forces that corrupted me.

Lines of *codetris* twisted and contorted to *the jazz*.

_The jazz!_

I don't remember much after that.

But I do remember the look of horror on the faces of those who played my creation.

And I couldn't help but laugh maniacally, knowing that I had become a vessel for the compiler, god of anguish.
